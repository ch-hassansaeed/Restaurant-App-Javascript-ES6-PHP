ES6 Javascript+PHP  (you can run it in wamp,xamp or other php servers because it needs to read JSON API endpoint)

#Features of this project
-As sample.json don't have images path so I am showing pictures randomly from images folder for presentable GUI <br />

-we can add any restaurant as a favourite/bookmark  <br />
-even we can show all favourites restaurants with toggle button 
-on restaurants listing page restaurants are sorted with following groups and filters criteria
#restaurants group by criteria:-
