# This Take Away and Near Away application built in two projects (because you didn't mention any language but as takeaway using ES6 and laravel that's why I am using laravel, ES6 and PHP for these projects)
project 1: ES6 javascript+PHP 
project2: laravel +ES6
for run both project we require PHP server because it needs to read JSON API endpoint

these are the name of project folders
project 1:takeaway_js : ES6 Javascript+PHP  (you can run it in wamp,xamp or other php servers)
project 2:takeaway_restaurants_app : laravel +ES6  (you can directly run it with laravel server 'php artisan serve' command)

#Note: both projects have the same functionalities 

#Features of this project
-As sample.json don't have images path so I am showing pictures randomly from images folder for presentable GUI
-we can search for any restaurant by title (using contain filter)
-we can add any restaurant as a favourite/bookmark 
-even we can show all favourites restaurants with toggle button 
-on restaurants listing page restaurants are sorted with following groups and filters criteria
#restaurants group by criteria:-
=>Top favourites restaurants
=>after that open restaurants
=>after that order ahead restaurants
=>after that close restaurants
#restaurants sorting by criteria:-
=>Best Match
=>Newest
=>Rating average
=>Distance
=>Popularity
=>Average Product Price
=>Delivery Costs
=>Minimum Cost
-rating stars and other restaurant data is showing dynamically
-The GUI of this project is responsive that's why it is showing well even on mobile devices.
